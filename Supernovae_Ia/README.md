Supernovae type Ia plot
=======================

This plots the SNIa rate of your simulation (from SNIa.txt),
this can be plotted against other simulations and is a comparison
with the observations. 

To plot simulations, add them to the dictionary in the plotSNIaRate.py,
called 'simulations'. They are key-value pairs, with the key being the path
to the simulation directory (i.e. the directory where SNIa.txt lives),
and the value being the 'fancy' name you would like in the legend.
